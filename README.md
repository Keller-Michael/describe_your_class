# ðŸ“£ Tell the world about your new awesome class

*Yes, each of us has experienced this: It's a cool party, everyone is having fun and you want to tell your friends about this new, super awesome class you wrote last weekend during a long night shift. But then you simply don't have the words to describe so much technical beauty. Ouch! But wait, this doesn't have to happen to you again. Here are a few ideas for describing your class to others.*

Ok, the section before was the fun side of this repository. Here comes the hard truth: We developers rarely talk about our super-cool classes at parties, but we talk more often at work with colleagues, e.g. during a code review. This is exactly what the approaches from this repository are intended to help with. Along with interfaces, classes are the central building blocks of an application in object orientation. That's exactly why we can't talk about them enough.

Good luck and have fun! ðŸ˜ƒ

***Note:** I have compiled this collection based on my experience with the ABAP Objects programming language. Since every programming language has its own special features, I try to make suggestions that are as cross-language as possible. Everyone is welcome to help.*

## Describe the high-level context of your class

This is a simple, high-level classification of your class into two categories:

* **Business object**: Your class represents a business object or part of it. An example of a business object is a purchase order; part of a purchase order are its purchase order items. 

* **Technical object**: Your class represents a technical object such as an email or a service for sending an email.

## Describe the character of your class

| Characteristic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Utility/Helper class | Your class may contain only static methods that represent helper functions. |
| Test class | Your class contains test methods or is part of a test infrastructure. |
| Exception class | Your class is for error handling. |
| Factory class | Your class creates an object of another class in a special way. |

## Describe the tier your class belongs to

Your class belongs to one of these tiers:

* Presentation tier
* Application tier
* Data tier

Check this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture) for more information.

## Describe the layer your class belongs to

Your class belongs to one of these layers:

* Presentation layer 
* Application layer 
* Business layer 
* Data access layer

Check this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Layers) for more informationen.

## Describe the focus of your class

* Focus on data
* Focus on algorithms
* Good mix of both

## Describe your class based on its characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| is local (possibly ABAP-specific) | Your class is in another development object such as a report. | 
| is global (possibly ABAP-specific) | Your class is part of the repository. |
| is stateful | The class has attributes. |
| is stateless | The class has no attributes. |
| is mutable | The attributes of the class can be changed. Typically there are Setter-methods for this task. |
| is immutable | The attributes of the class cannot be changed and are initially set once in the constructor. |
| is abstract | Your class models some common behaviour for one or more subclasses. |
| is final | No subclass of your class is possible. |
| is completely static | Your class offers only static methods and attributes. |
| inherits from | Bring your class in context of the class it's inherits from. |
| is testable | You provide unit tests for your class. |
| implements interface(s) | Your class makes use of one or more interfaces. | 
| has factory methods | Describe why the standard constructor was not enough. |
| has public attributes | Why are the attributes public and not private with Getter/Setter-methods? |
| is a Singleton | There's only one object of your class possible. |

## Describe your class based on its neighborhood

Your class works with other classes to implement functionality. This can be done via [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) or [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition). Describe the connections so that your class can be better classified. For example, design patterns are often composed of different classes with specific individual tasks that together provide a unity.

## Describe your class based on numbers

Here are a few suggestions:

| Characteristic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Number of attributes | A few (private) attributes are usually good. |
| Number of public methods | Fewer public methods makes your class easier to understand for consumers. |
| Lines of Code | It depends on the programming language but less is most of the time faster to understand. |
| Number of interfaces | Is there even an interface that your class implements? Maybe several? |

## Describe the requirements for using your class

There may be various requirements for your class to do its job. The constructor may need to be supplied with certain objects, or public methods may need to be called in a certain order.

## Describe the exception behaviour of your class

Usually nothing goes wrong. Well, until that one moment for which you have fortunately programmed exception handling. What does the exception look like?

## Describe your class using the associated design pattern

| Design Pattern | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Value object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object) | Your class repesents a simple value like an amount of money. |
| [Data transfer object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) | Your class helps to exchange data between processes. |
| Parameter object | Bundle related parameters into one object. |
| [Facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) | Your class hides complex logic and makes it easier for the consumer. |
