# üñ•Ô∏è Tell about your new awesome class

*Yes, each of us has experienced this: It's a cool party, everyone is having fun and you want to tell your friends about this new, super awesome class you wrote last weekend during a long night shift. But then you simply don't have the words to describe so much technical beauty. Ouch! But wait, this doesn't have to happen to you again. Here are a few ideas for describing your class to others.*

Ok, the section before was the fun side of this repository. Here comes the hard truth: We developers rarely talk about our super-cool classes at parties, but we talk more often at work with colleagues, e.g. during a code review. This is exactly what the approaches from this repository are intended to help with. 

Good luck and have fun! üòÉ

## Describe your class based on its characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| stateful | The class has attributes. that can be changed. Typically there are setter methods for this. |
| stateless | The class has no attributes. |
| mutable | The attributes of the class can be changed. Typically there are Setter-methods for this task. |
| immutable | The attributes of the class cannot be changed and are initially set once in the constructor. |
| abstract | Your class models some common behaviour for one or more subclasses. |
| final | No subclass of your class is possible. |
| inherits from | Bring your class in context of the class it's inherits from. |
| testable | You provide unit tests for your class. |

## Describe your class based on its neighborhood

## Describe your class based on numbers

## Describe your class using the associated design pattern

| Design Pattern | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Value object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_object) | Your class repesents a simple value like an amount of money. |
| [Data transfer object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object) | Your class helps to exchange data between processes. |
| Parameter object | Bundle related parameters into one object. |
